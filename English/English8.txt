Yesterday I watched Christmas Chronicles. It's nice and good film about Santa Claus and two curious children. I don't remeber their names, but they are brother and sister that catched Santa and got into the sleigh while he was preparing presents for them.
Then, in time of flying, sister was cold and asked Santa for blanket. He wasn't ready to see anyone in his sleigh and lost control. As result his magic hat got lost and deers - too, and gift bag - too.
In that case team tried to find help, but nobody believed that cute-looked Santa is real (althrough he knows all their wishes for all christmases) so they stole bright red car and started an expedition.
Sister found deerds, brother found bag and offenders that stole him with bag, Santa was imprisoned.
Sister found elves, brothes was almost cut in half by them, Santa gave a concert at the police station.
They got together obly an hour before dawn, so they had ti work together to be in time with presents: Santa teleported from chimney to chimney, sister threw presents from sleigh, brother drove.
P.S. Before this adventure, brother was going to become bad guy, but after it his life changed.
Happy-end.
